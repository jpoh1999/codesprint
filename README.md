## Features

- **Efficient Container Reshuffling**: Two models that optimize the arrangement and retrieval of containers in a yard.
- **Data Lake Integration**: Hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- **Interactive Visualization**: A front-end application to visualize solutions generated by the reshuffling models, allowing for intuitive analysis of container arrangements.

## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: JavaScript, Python
- **Frameworks**: React, Flask (or any other frameworks you used)
- **Cloud Services**: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- **Data Handling**: PapaParse, other relevant libraries

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps to run the program locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/codesprint.git
   cd codesprint
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

  ```bash
  python -r requirements.txt
  cd client
  npm install
  ```
3. Generate the solution from main program
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```

4. Set Up Google Cloud Data Lake from Terraform IAC
   ```bash
   cd cloud
   terraform init
   terraform plan
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Set Up API EndPoints
   ```bash
   cd server
   node server.js
   ```

6. Set Up Development Environment
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

## Usage

Once the server is running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to access the application. 

1. Upload the necessary container data files.
2. Run the reshuffling models to generate optimal container arrangements.
3. Visualize the solutions interactively through the front-end application.

## Data Management

The project utilizes a data lake hosted on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to store and manage relevant files for containerization challenges. This enables efficient data retrieval and integration into the reshuffling models.

## Visualization

The front-end application provides a dynamic interface for visualizing the results of the container reshuffling models. Users can observe the arrangement of containers and the proposed solutions, facilitating better decision-making in yard logistics.
